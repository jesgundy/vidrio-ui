## Features

- **Syntax:** Plain Text and Markdown. Clicking the label swaps it back and forth.
- **Local Storage:** If your browser supports it, your content is stored locally while you type. Command-s / ctrl-s are remapped mostly to keep me from going crazy because I mash the save hotkey while I write out of habit.


*Fair Warning: DO NOT depend on Jot for storing your content. Clearing your cache will blow away local storage and any content you had saved here. Jot is intended to be a zero-barrier way to start taking notes quickly, not a long term storage space for notes.*
